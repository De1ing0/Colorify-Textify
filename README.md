When Colorify/Textify is used for the first time, user needs to login into his Spotify account.
Program will automatically redirect user to a web browser with Spotify login page. 
After logging in, user will be redirected to another website. Address of this website needs to
be pasted to the console. This process is compulsory and is defined by Python library - Spotipy.
